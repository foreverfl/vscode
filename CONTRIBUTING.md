## What is this repository for?

This repository contains the localization files for Visual Studio Code.  
All translated files are located in the `i18n` folder.

## How can I contribute?

### About Translation

- All markdown files are automatically translated as drafts using [my translation CLI project](https://github.com/foreverfl/doc-translation).
- I only review and refine the parts of the documentation that I plan to read, so the draft translations (generated with GPT-4o-mini) may not be perfect.
- If you want to contribute, please update markdown files in the `i18n` folder.  
  If a markdown file ends with `_original.md`, it means that the file is only a draft translation.

### About Design

- My goal is to make the documentation's design similar to the original.
- If you want to contribute, please open an issue and suggest what you want to change.

### Git Workflow

- Please fork this repository and create a new branch for your changes.
- Before you create a pull request, make sure your changes are up-to-date with the latest changes in the `main` branch by using rebase.
